## How to install?
Create folder where you want to keep project, for example 
> root\MyProject

Create Dependencies folder where you keep all additional libraries.
> root\MyProject\Dependencies

Move there downloaded libraries ImGui, OGRE-next.

### OGRE

For OGRE and it's dependencies do build with this tutorial step-by-step 

https://ogrecave.github.io/ogre-next/api/latest/_setting_up_ogre_windows.html#BuildingOgreWindows

### ImGui

Works out-of-the-box. If not, please add CMakeLists with ImGui lib definition to Dependencies folder.
Then include it in main CMakeLists.

### Execution build

After proper installation hit compile on release version.
